<h1>How our App works</h1>

<p class="static-page-text"> Our app listens to the requests made by other apps to different services (like geolocation, contacts etc.) and logs them into a database (which lies inside your phone).
Once we have the information in the database, we compare with the limit (total number of times a specific app accessed that one single service) what you set or defaults what we set, for each service.
If the app excees the limit - we raise a flag and alert you that this app is getting your information more than required number of times.

<p class="static-page-text">
	You can then disable that access to the app (from Settings -> App Permissions -> (app name) --> Under Permissions section (Ask, Grant, Deny )
