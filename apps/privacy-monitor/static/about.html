<h1>About Privacy Monitor</h1>
<p class="static-page-text"> 
	Privacy Monitor helps you know what type of information is being accessed by your apps and how frequently they are accessing it. 
</p>
<p class="static-page-text"> 
	Our main mission is to give the access control to the you (user) so you can set the app-to-service access frequency limit to every installed app 
</p>

<p class="static-page-text"> We are not collecting any information from your phone and selling it to anyone.<br/> <br/>
	<strong>So what we do? </strong><br/>
We monitor installed apps and log the required information (like what app is accessing what type of service?, and when is it accessing?
</p>

<p class="static-page-text">
	Once logged into the database (which is inside your phone), we just alert you by comparing the limit what you set with the actual access frequency.
</p>
