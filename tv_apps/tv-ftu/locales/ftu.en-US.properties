initial-activation=Initial Activation: Upon initial activation of your Firefox OS device, Firefox OS sends to Mozilla a one-time data ping (e.g., data relating to device specific information such as software release version, partner ID, country and screen size) which helps Mozilla determine if security updates and critical fixes are needed for our users and partners, determine requirements for app developers so they can build better apps for our users, and helps Mozilla with market analysis (e.g., determine how many devices have been activated).
app-usage=App Usage: In order to improve content discovery on Firefox Marketplace, Firefox OS sends "Application Usage Information" (e.g., active use time, counts of opens/closes/crashes, list of uninstalled apps on Firefox OS devices) to Mozilla. You can disable the sharing of App Usage Information in the Firefox OS “Settings” app on your device.
